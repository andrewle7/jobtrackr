            <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
        </header>
        
        <p>For our problem domain, our team will be addressing the lack of data collection for the local Seattle
            community in regards to being able to seamlessly navigate thrift pop-ups stores, flea markets, and other means
            of sustainable and reusable clothing. Reusing clothing provides a zero waste,  low cost option when shopping 
            for apparel. The proliferation of recycled clothing establishments  in the Greater Seattle area, arising from
            a large demand, has left the community with an array of options to purchase used/thrifted clothing. This has 
            left an unmet need of an information technology solution,  in terms of the community understanding what options
            are available to them (type) , as well as  when and where these options will be locally available. 
        </p>
        <p>          Although global, a previous solution that attempted to solve a similar issue is Thriftigo. Thriftigo found 
            the best thrift stores near you, and allowed for users to share what was purchased to compare what has been
            thrifted at which locations. This mobile application did not succeed in identifying when community meet ups or
            other reusable clothing events  took place , and therefore lacked a sense of community and inspiration within 
            Seattle. Thriftigo has since been removed from the app store.</p>

            <h2>App Description</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            With the rising popularity of secondhand markets and goods, the industry for this in terms of reselling used goods has boomed. 
            This has also led to a trend of emerging small businesses selling second hand “vintage” goods themselves. With nostalgia and social 
            trends leading the forefront, the main users of this application will be those who are newer to the secondhand market, or those that 
            are well-versed and need a hub to keep track of all flea markets happening in their area. This application could be used by the consumer 
            as well as sellers of secondhand goods, making the demographic of the users extremely diverse in age and background. With exposure to 
            these local flea markets being mainly word of mouth, or in complicated Seattle traveler guides, this application would allow a user to 
            keep informed of everything going on, as well as support the local businesses that attend these events. With features such as filtering events 
            happening in a specific area/radius of the user, they can find what is happening closest to them and when. Once the user finds a flea market 
            they want to attend, they can create an account using their email, gmail, etc. and add it to a personal calendar, with the ones they want to 
            go to displayed and saved in one place. Keeping in mind the demographic of sellers utilizing this app, there will be also be an option to add 
            a flea market of your own that you are hosting to the pool, and increase exposure to the smaller events/markets that they may have going on as well. 
        </p>

        <p>Users will be viewing pop-ups/flea markets within the neighborhood and category they have filtered their search for. 
            This will include the name, image, hours of business, and exact location of their desired search. This is going to help 
            users find flea markets and pop-up shops easily and conveniently. Making it easy to find affordable stores will encourage 
            people to reuse or resell their items instead of adding on to the waste problems we have today. For low-income individuals 
            who use pop-ups or flea markets as their primary source of shopping, having knowledge of where each store is can give them 
            additional sources of finding affordable apparel and other items they may need.</p>
