            <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
        </header>
        
        <p>For our problem domain, our team will be addressing the lack of data collection for the local Seattle
            community in regards to being able to seamlessly navigate thrift pop-ups stores, flea markets, and other means
            of sustainable and reusable clothing. Reusing clothing provides a zero waste,  low cost option when shopping 
            for apparel. The proliferation of recycled clothing establishments  in the Greater Seattle area, arising from
            a large demand, has left the community with an array of options to purchase used/thrifted clothing. This has 
            left an unmet need of an information technology solution,  in terms of the community understanding what options
            are available to them (type) , as well as  when and where these options will be locally available. 
        </p>
        <p>          Although global, a previous solution that attempted to solve a similar issue is Thriftigo. Thriftigo found 
            the best thrift stores near you, and allowed for users to share what was purchased to compare what has been
            thrifted at which locations. This mobile application did not succeed in identifying when community meet ups or
            other reusable clothing events  took place , and therefore lacked a sense of community and inspiration within 
            Seattle. Thriftigo has since been removed from the app store.</p>
