# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive job tracker web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool. Using Job Trackr, you can get resume tips and keep track of all the jobs you applied to. As students apply to hundreds of jobs it is easy to lose track of what you applied to, so using Job Trackr can keep you organized by allowing you to list your jobs, update their application status, and filter through them. 

Our website can be found at, https://jobtrackr-d910d.web.app.

Enjoy staying organized and good luck on your job hunt!
